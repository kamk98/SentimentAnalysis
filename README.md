# Sentiment Analysis


This is a Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers. Because this is real commercial data, it has been anonymized, and references to the company in the review text and body have been replaced with “retailer”. This dataset includes 23486 rows and 10 feature variables. Each row corresponds to a customer review, and includes the variables:

Clothing ID: Integer Categorical variable that refers to the specific piece being reviewed.

**Age**: Positive Integer variable of the reviewers age.    

**Title**: String variable for the title of the review.

**Review Text**: String variable for the review body.

**Rating**: Positive Ordinal Integer variable for the product score granted by the customer from 1 Worst, to 5 Best.

**Recommended IND**: Binary variable stating where the customer recommends the product where 1 is recommended, 0 is not recommended.

**Positive Feedback Count**: Positive Integer documenting the number of other customers who found this review positive.

**Division Name**: Categorical name of the product high level division.

**Department Name**: Categorical name of the product department name.

**Class Name**: Categorical name of the product class name.


## Aim
This project deals with the fundamentals of natural language processing. We will be performing sentiment analysis i.e., building prediction models aimed at predicting the rating of the products, based on the textual reviews submitted by users.

## Background
This is a project that was assigned to me when I was a machine learning intern at a Bangalore (India) based e-learning institute called Verzeo. This was a comprehensive internship which taught concepts of machine learning and data science that cemented my foundations in the field of data analytics.
